The data from sensor can be used or other software can be used for analysis.
5. The project report should include the following discussion:
a. Is the accuracy of the measurements consistent across multiple working distance? Discuss the
findings from the data.
b. Is there a difference in accuracy of the measurements with respect to object type? Discuss the
findings from the data.
c. Theoretically, does light conditions affect the accuracy of the sensor measurements? Based on
the conducted experiment, did you observe effect of the light conditions on the data accuracy?
Discuss the findings from the data.
